## Listen.
Something for Audiotool.
First time I've touched my hands into authenticating users and stuffs like that.

## Concept

Sometimes, I prevent to listen to a track because of its title, cover art, number of favorites.

This app gives you no information about the track you're listening to (not even the track's name - unless you pull up the console).

Just log into your [Audiotoool](http://audiotool.com), and enjoy. 

There are only 3 buttons for your need: Play/Pause , Link to Track, and a Fav.

## Install

Just put this HTML into any of your server and it works instantly.

## Usage.

Give you 25 tracks playlist provided by Audiotool's `/browse/suggestions`. 

The available hotkeys are:
P, I, S, F, R, N, X, H (**P**lay/Pause, **I**nformation, **S**kip, **F**avorite, **R**emix, Refresh, Log Out, **H**elp)

## Known Bugs
The famous prevent-autoplay on mobile.
