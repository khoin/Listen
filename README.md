## Listen.
Something for Audiotool.
First time I've touched my hands into authenticating users and stuffs like that.

## Install

Just put this HTML into any of your server and it works instantly.

## Usage.

Give you 25 tracks playlist provided by Audiotool's `/browse/suggestions`. It's pretty cool since it chooses new tracks and I think it also check on the genres?
