## Listen.
Something for Audiotool.
First time I've touched my hands into authenticating users and stuffs like that.

## Concept

Sometimes, I avoid listening to a track because of its title, cover art, number of favorites.

This app gives you no information about the track you're listening to (not even the track's name - unless you pull up the console).

Just log into your [Audiotool](http://audiotool.com), and enjoy the compiled playlist

## Install

Upload this PHP file onto any server and it works.

## Usage.

Give you 25 tracks playlist provided by Audiotool's `/browse/suggestions`. 

The available hotkeys are:
* __P__lay/Pause
* __I__nformation (Open new tab with the current track)
* → Right Arrow Key: Next Track
* ← Left Arrow Key: Previous Track
* __F__avorite Current Track
* __R__emix track (if possible
* __N__: Refresh page (somewhat will purge the playlist compilation)
* __X__: Log out
* __H__: Help

## Known Bugs
The famous prevent-autoplay on mobile.
